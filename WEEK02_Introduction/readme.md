Basic blink using the vTaskDelay. vTaskDelay will suspend that current thread and run the next lower prioirty threads.

2) Two LEDs 2 Blinking Rates:

The scheduler splits the time evenly for these two threads.

3) Triple Blink, with 3 Rates and 3 Different Priorities

Experimentating with more LEDs with 3 Priorities levels.

Conclusion:
From these programs, I found out how create a simple RTOS program. I found how to create multiple task threads and apply it to cores whilst also adjusting the priority if necessary. With the examples above, I showed how to blink multiple LEDs with delay without any thread being blocked.
